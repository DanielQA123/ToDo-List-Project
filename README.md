#Project Description

This repository is to show the creation of a basic To-Do List web app, by using the learning material from week 1-7 from QA Academy. To develop a To-Do List Web Application that has a working frontend and backend with full use of the CRUD functionality when connected to a local SQL database. 
Where the code is tested using methods such as JUnit, Intergration and Selenium testing. This README file will give you the material to download the required software needed for the project, 
some notes about the types of test conducted for the project and any other useful information.

## Getting Started

The instructions below will help you get a version of this project up and running in a local environment or on your local machine for developing and testing purposes. 
See the prequisites and the deployment section for further details about the live environment and any other related info about the project.


1. **You can fork and clone this repository to a folder on your local computer.**  
2. **Open the project in your SpringBoot IDE as a Maven project/Spring project.** 
3. ** You will need to open Postman and type the local host URL for the command you want to test to see if it works.**
4. ** You will need to open a localhost URL to test the database connection (i.e. localost:8080/h2) or change the jdbc URL in the application properties class in the src/main/resources folder to connect the database on a GCP or another SQL host.**

## Testing 

 - What is Testing:
    - Testing helps us test the functionality of a code to determine how well it works in a working environment. 
    - Its important because it increases the quality of the delivered code. This means code is less likely to break when in use.
    - For this project a JUnit test, a mockito test and intergration test were conducted
    - A Selenium test was also conducted to record how well the front-end section of the works.

    
1. JUnit Testing:
    - A JUnit test is  
    * [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/)


3. What steps need to be taken when conducting tests?
    - Do they need to install any software?
    - Is there any hardware requirements or dependencies?
    - After the installation, how they compile or run the code?
4. Execution examples
    - You could provide examples of execution with code and screenshots

other things you could add:

- Table of content
- Test cases
- Know bugs
- Version
- Contributors
- License
- References
