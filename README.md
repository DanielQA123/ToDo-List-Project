## Testing 

 - What is Testing:
    - Testing helps us test the functionality of a code to determine how well it works in a working environment. 
    - Its important because it increases the quality of the delivered code. This means code is less likely to break when in use.
    - For this project a JUnit test, a mockito test and intergration test were conducted
